 # Time Series Forecasting on Energy Consumption Data Using XGBoost

## Project Description:

The project involves the application of the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to forecast energy consumption based on historical data. This involves analyzing time series data of energy usage, which can include factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and other relevant variables that might affect energy consumption.

## Project Goal:

The primary goal of this project is to create an accurate model that can predict future energy consumption patterns. This can help in efficient energy management and planning, allowing for better utilization of energy resources, and potentially leading to cost savings and reduced environmental impact. The XGBoost algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in handling time-series data and its ability to manage multiple features that may influence energy consumption.
